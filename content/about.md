Hello world, I'm Olivier.

I’m a **product- & project manager with a technical background**. I've delivered software products from start to finish for startups and multinationals alike. Building and working with a technical team to deliver great products is where I am at my best.

Experienced along the project lifecycle as a product, project & engineering manager. Responsibilities included agile project management, technical architecture, business analysis, technical analysis, product design, software engineering & dev-ops, hiring, DPO, applying scrum methodology and more.

A great user experience, security and maintainable code are important for me and contribute to both the end-user and developers’ happiness.

I am ambitious and driven with an inexhaustible curiosity which always keeps me learning.
My interests are broad but my main passion lies in **improving the state of privacy and security in IT.**

In my spare time I like to be outdoors, preferably in nature, and staying active.
All the better if I can combine the two. I love skiing and kitesurfing when the weather allows it.
When it doesn't I like running, cycling or swimming and try to improve myself by participating in
triatlons, trailruns and marathons.
