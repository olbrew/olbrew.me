Hello world, I'm Olivier.

I'm a **freelance product owner & project manager** whose experience lies in leading technical teams and providing technical guidance. I’m at my best translating business needs into technological solutions with and for a team.

A great user experience, security and maintainable code are important for me and contribute to both the end-user and developers’ happiness.

I am ambitious and driven with a never-ending curiosity which always keeps me learning.

My interests are broad but my main passion lies in **improving the state of privacy and security in IT.**

In my spare time I like to be outdoors, preferably in nature, and staying active.
All the better if I can combine the two. I love skiing and kitesurfing when the weather allows it.
When it doesn't I like running, cycling or swimming and try to improve myself by participating in
triatlons, trailruns and marathons.

You can find my full cv on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olbrew/) or here in a [PDF](/Resume-Olivier-Brewaeys.pdf).

If you like to contact me, send me an email at **[olivier at olbrew dot me]** or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olbrew).
